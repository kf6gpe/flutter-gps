# mygps

A simple project showing GPS and map integration in Flutter.

To use this, you'll need to have an map API key from Google, and
add it to your project:


Get an API key at https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/.

Specify your API key in the application manifest 
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:


```xml
<manifest ...
  <application ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
               android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>

```
